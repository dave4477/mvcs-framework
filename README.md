# mvcs-framework

A simple MVCS framework written in Javascript.
This includes a stateConfig.json to include a finite statemachine, however this is optional.
There are some utilities included, like an audio manager.
For backwards compatibility I have used babel.

To see how to bootstrap, look in main.js in the app folder.
If you either import the release module or include the script tag, 
there is no need to import the core classes for the view, controller, model or service.
